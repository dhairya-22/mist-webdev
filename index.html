                He spiked his hair green to support his iguana. He dreamed of
                leaving his law firm to open a portable dog wash. He found a
                leprechaun in his walnut shell. Italy is my favorite country: in

                realized she had a sixth sense. Flesh-colored yoga pants were
                far worse than even he feared. She was sad to hear that
